       "in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable " \
       "of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in " \
       "December  1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, " \
       "until 12 July 2018, when he announced his 'permanent vacation' from his responsibilities as Python's ' \
      'benevolent dictator for life', a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term " \
       "commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected " \
       "a five-member Steering Council to lead the project."
